title: The Intersection of Charm and Connection
body: With great schools close by, and just minutes from the small-town charms
  of downtown Kyle, The Brick & Mortar District is a bright new destination in
  the award-winning Plum Creek community—bustling with over 2,000 homes
  and  over 300 acres of commercial development. Hop onto I-35 and you’re off to
  the big city attractions of Austin or even San Antonio. It’s the perfect
  balance of what you need close by, along with convenient big city access.
