  The Brick & Mortar District will be a welcome respite from the increasingly
  virtual lives we lead socially, in school, and in business. Through thoughtful
  design and an array of experiences, belonging, connection, and well-being
  radiate here. The variety of those experiences—from working and playing to
  gathering and relaxing— is the mix we’re talking about.


  Because just like a playlist, or a guest list for that matter, our mix dials up the excitement and dials in the chemistry. As much as anything else, The Brick & Mortar District is a celebration of a place—where what you need and what you love are next door neighbors.


  More to see, do, and enjoy. More to the mix.
