title: Destined for Destination
body: The Brick & Mortar District will be a visitor destination—as focused on
  fun, wellness, and relaxation as it is on urbane pursuits. Our sportsplex
  fields will be magnets for soccer tournaments and team sports. Our park will
  be a venue for Kyle, TX concerts and events, as well as a buzzing, fresh air
  draw—from its creative playground and splash area to its volleyball courts and
  quiet places to sit and/or have a conversation. An adjoining marketplace and
  food trucks will provide fuel for all that positive energy. Just a quick
  stroll away is The Heroes Memorial, which honors first responders and war
  veterans. Add to that curated shopping and dining in the District itself, and
  you’ve got a mix destined for delight.
