# Info


## What is this site?

This is a Jekyll flat file website. It lives in a github repo. When changes ("commits") are added to the main branch, the site is compiled and a final stack of html pages is generated. A service called Netlify is used to host the bundle of pages, which are the whole website. Netlify also provides the CMS capabilities, allowing you to go to /admin from the front end of the site, and see a panel where you can change the content. I can add and change the fields that are shown in the CMS. It supports multiple users, and draft versions of any content changes which can be published later.
